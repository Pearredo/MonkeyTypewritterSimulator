# MonkeyTypewritterSimulator
this program simulates the Infinite Monkey Theorem through a shortcut. The program generates random strings, whenever a string matchesa word in the inputted file, that word is displayed. when all words are found the program will stop. this will obviously take a while especially with the text file in the folder which is the script for Hamlet.

Tried to upload the code through Visual Studio 2019 but the program kept crashing. executable not included

this program will take an inputted file, take the individual words and put them into a Set so that there will be no repeated words. the program will create a
random string of a random length, every time the program creates a string that matches one in the Set, that word will be displayed. the program will continue to run
until there are no more words inthe set (this will take a long time, this is only to simulate the theorem).
